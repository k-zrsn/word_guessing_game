# UMD Word Guessing Game


## Description
A guessing game where users have to guess the letters of a word and figure out what it is.

The word bank's theme is UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BUILDINGS


## Rules:
- One or more players can play and players take turns to guess a letter.

- Players can take as many **letter guesses** as they want,
however, each player only has three **word guess** attempts, and they lose the game for everyone if they get their third guess
wrong.

- A playerâ€™s final score is the number of **turns** (letter guesses) they made before guessing the correct word. Lower scores are better.


## How to play
1. The game will begin by welcoming players and ask how many players are playing and their names.

2. Players will then start taking turns guessing letters. On every turn, an updated list of correct and incorrect letters will be presented.

3. Players will also have the option to guess the word.

4. Once a player has three wrong word guesses, the game is lost.

5. If a player has correctly guessed the word, they win and a scoreboard will be presented.

6. After ten guesses and players still can't figure out the word, they will have the option to give up.
