A guessing game where users have to guess the letters of a word and figure out what it is.

The word bank's theme is UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BUILDINGS


Rules:
- One or more players can play and players take turns to guess a letter.

- Players can take as many letter guesses as they want,
however, each player only has three word guess attempts, and they lose the game for everyone if they get their third guess
wrong.

- A playerâ€™s final score is the number of turns (letter guesses) they made before guessing the correct word. Lower scores are better.
