A guessing game where users have to guess the letters of a word that has randomly been chosen from a word bank and figure out the secret word. 

One or more players can play and players take turns to guess.

A player’s final score is the number of turns (letter guesses) they made before guessing the correct word. Lower scores are better.

Each player only has three word guesses, and they lose the game if they get their third guess
wrong.
